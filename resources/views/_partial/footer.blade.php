            <h3>THE MEANING OF OUR LOGO</h3>
            <p>In the logo of vKirirom - you will find '<span style="color: orange;">v</span>' in orange and <span style="color: green;">'Kirirom'</span> in green. The orange colour represents the people who live in Kirirom. This is the colour of joy and creativity. It also reminds us  of the robes monks wear in Cambodia. The green represents the nature and its beauty.</p>
